## The Vision

The pet grooming industry is a **$11 billion market** in the US alone — yet it's still almost entirely manual. Long wait times, inconsistent results, and high costs frustrate millions of pet owners every year.

**My solution:** An AI-powered automated grooming booth that uses computer vision to detect a dog's size and coat type, then automatically configures water temperature, pressure, shampoo type, and drying settings — with zero human intervention.

Think of it as the **"car wash for dogs"** — but smart.

## How It Works

```
Dog enters booth
      ↓
Camera + sensors scan the dog (size, weight, coat type)
      ↓
CNN model classifies: breed / size / coat
      ↓
AI decision engine sets grooming parameters
      ↓
Machine auto-adjusts: water temp, pressure, nozzles, dryer
      ↓
Owner gets report on mobile app
```

## Features

- **Dog size detection** — Small / Medium / Large / Extra Large
- **Coat type analysis** — Short, Long, Curly, Double Coat, Wire
- **Automated grooming parameters** — wash temp, duration, shampoo, brush type
- **Real-time mobile app** — owners monitor the session remotely
- **Cloud storage** — every session saved to AWS S3
- **REST API** — FastAPI backend, fully documented
